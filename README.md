## Introduction

At Crema, we are committed to delivering high-quality products that meet and exceed our clients' expectations.

This document serves as a guide to our development practices. It outlines the conventions, tools, and methodologies that shape our work, providing a framework to ensure every member of our team is aligned in their approach to development.

By establishing clear norms and defaults, we aim to streamline our processes, maintain high degree of quality, facilitate effective collaboration, and create an environment of continuous learning and improvement. These practices also help us navigate complex projects with multiple hands, enabling us to efficiently coordinate our efforts and maintain consistency across our work.

Whether you are a seasoned member of the Crema team or a newcomer, this document is intended to provide a clear understanding of our development practices. We encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with these guidelines and incorporate them into their daily work. At the same time, we believe that our norms and defaults should evolve with our team and industry. Therefore, we welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Let's continue to collaborate, innovate, and create extraordinary digital products together.

## Golden Rule

Use common sense, talk to your team, find agreement. These are just guidelines.

## Agile

At Crema we practice Agile methodology, here is a quick refresher on the core of this practice. These ideas were first captured in the Agile Manifesto, which outlines four core values and twelve guiding principles.

Agile is an adaptive, people-focused approach to software development, rooted in iterative progress, flexible responses to change, and a customer-oriented mindset.

### Agile Values

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Agile Principles

1. **Customer satisfaction**: Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. **Embrace change**: Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. **Frequent delivery**: Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. **Collaboration**: Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. **Supportive environments**: Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. **Face-to-face communication**: The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. **Working software**: Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. **Sustainable development**: Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. **Technical excellence**: Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. **Simplicity**: Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
11. **Self-organizing teams**: The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. **Regular reflection**: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

As we continue our work at Crema, let's always bear in mind these values and principles. They should guide our practices, shape our culture, and help us continually improve our approach to development.
